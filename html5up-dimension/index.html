                <span class="image main"><img src="images\BME CMU.png" alt="BME CMU" /></span>
                <p>As a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, I am at the forefront of pioneering research aimed at revolutionizing the prevention and treatment of orthopedic and musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis and scoliosis. My work leverages the cutting-edge intersection of biomechanics, image analysis, and tissue regeneration to drive advancements in healthcare technologies. Also, my role as a Teaching Assistant for the bioinstrumentation course at CMU allows me to share my knowledge and passion, further enriching my academic experience.</p>
                <p>My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Medical Electronics from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering in Bangalore, India, laying the groundwork for my expertise in biomedical engineering. This education fueled my passion for creating impactful healthcare solutions, particularly for those in marginalized and underprivileged communities.</p>
                <p>Prior to joining CMU, I contributed to Janitri, an innovative startup focused on enhancing pregnancy monitoring through state-of-the-art devices and software applications. My role encompassed product and software training, installation, troubleshooting, and customer support, alongside rigorous analysis of product usage statistics. This experience sharpened my skills in technical communication, problem-solving, and user-centric product development.</p>
                <p>My industry exposure is further enriched by internships that spanned critical healthcare technologies, including radiology and neonatal devices, as well as ventilators. A notable internship with Cognizant Technology Solutions honed my programming abilities in Java and web automation, complementing my engineering expertise with robust software development skills.</p>
                <p>I bring to the table a unique blend of engineering acumen, hands-on industry experience, and a deep-seated commitment to improving healthcare outcomes. With a collaborative spirit and a continuous thirst for learning, I am eager to contribute to and grow within an organization that shares my vision for a healthier, more accessible world.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I am deeply interested in biomedical wearables and sports technology. I aim to integrate biomedical data into sports to enhance player analysis and support, particularly during injuries. Leveraging computer vision and other advanced technologies, I seek to develop innovative solutions that can provide real-time insights and aid in the recovery and performance optimization of athletes.</p>

            <li>Pre Data Processing: Cleaned the data by removing null and duplicate values and performed data transformation.</li>
            <li>Exploratory Data Analysis: Used various plotting techniques to visualize relationships between attributes.</li>
            <li>Modeling: Applied four machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Classifier) to the dataset.</li>
            <li>Evaluation: Evaluated models using cross-validation, F1 score, and confusion matrix to select the best performing model.</li>
            <li>GUI Development: Developed a graphical user interface using Tkinter for easy input and display of prediction results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Results:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 95.32% among the tested algorithms.</li>
            <li>The model demonstrated high precision and reliability in predicting anemia.</li>
            <li>The GUI provided an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive immediate predictions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
        <p>This project successfully implemented a machine learning model to predict anemia with high accuracy. The use of Logistic Regression proved to be effective, and the developed GUI made the system accessible and user-friendly. This approach has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing anemia more efficiently.</p>
